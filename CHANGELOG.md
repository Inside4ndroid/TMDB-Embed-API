# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-16

### Added
- Comprehensive `README.md` (features, endpoints, admin UI overview, screenshots gallery, Docker usage, troubleshooting).
- `LICENSE` (MIT) file.
- Multiâ€‘TMDB key rotation support (array of keys; random selection per request).
- Config override system writing to `utils/user-config.json` with live merged view.
- Session-based authentication (login, logout, session check, password change) with brute-force mitigation.
- Rate limiting + exponential lockouts for failed login attempts.
- Provider status & metrics endpoints: `/api/health`, `/api/metrics`, `/api/status`, `/api/providers`.
- Stream aggregation endpoints (aggregate + provider-specific) with filtering pipeline.
- Diagnostics instrumentation (intercept `process.exit`, `beforeExit`, unhandled rejection / exception logging, periodic heartbeat interval).
- Docker assets: multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volume for overrides.
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) for automatic multi-arch (amd64+arm64) build & push on branch and tag (`v*`).
- OCI metadata labels and build argument (`VERSION`) in Docker image.
- Version + (placeholder) Docker pulls badges in README header.
- VidSrc extractor refactor: removed direct `process.exit` calls; `main()` now returns status code (safer when required as a module).

### Changed
- Config normalization now clears legacy single `tmdbApiKey` when `tmdbApiKeys` override is explicitly emptied.
- Dockerfile slimmed: narrowed COPY set, added labels, build arg, retained only necessary runtime artifacts.
- `.dockerignore` expanded to reduce build context (`.git`, logs, markdown except README, tests, CI configs, caches, compose file, etc.).

### Removed
- Deprecated `uhdmovies` provider: code file, registry references, UI toggles, documentation mentions.

### Security
- Hardened auth flow: session cookies (HttpOnly), no-store headers for admin pages, escalating lockouts against brute force.

### CI / Automation
- Added multi-arch Docker publish workflow using Buildx & QEMU.

### Documentation
- Added Docker usage section (local build, compose, multi-key usage, env vars table, healthcheck notes).
- Added screenshots gallery of admin UI.
- Updated docs to reflect provider removal and new configuration semantics.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Developer Experience
- Heartbeat diagnostic interval to aid investigation of unexpected exits.
- Intercepted premature `process.exit` calls to avoid silent shutdowns during debugging.

## Historical Context
This 1.0.0 release consolidates modernization work: provider cleanup, configuration clarity, deployment ergonomics (Docker + CI), security hardening, and observability.
